ATS Resume Scorer API
An intelligent backend service that leverages the Google Gemini API to analyze resumes, score them against specific criteria, and provide detailed, ATS-friendly feedback. This project is designed to simulate the initial, automated screening process for programs like the "Prime Minister Internship Scheme."

‚ú® Features
PDF Resume Parsing: Accepts PDF resume uploads and accurately extracts all text content using PyMuPDF.

AI-Powered Analysis: Uses the Gemini API for in-depth, contextual analysis of the resume text based on a detailed system prompt.

ATS Scoring: Provides a score out of 100 to quantify the resume's quality and alignment with the target role.

Structured Feedback: Returns a clean JSON response with actionable feedback and suggestions for improvement across different sections of the resume.

Built with FastAPI: Asynchronous, high-performance, and includes automatic interactive documentation (Swagger UI).

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Backend Framework: FastAPI

Web Server: Uvicorn (for development), Gunicorn (for production)

PDF Parsing: PyMuPDF

AI Model: Google Gemini API

Configuration: python-dotenv

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Python 3.9+

An active Google Gemini API Key.

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name/ats_scorer

Create and activate a virtual environment:

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure environment variables:

Create a .env file in the ats_scorer directory by copying the .env.example file.

Add your Gemini API key to the .env file:

GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

Running the Application
For Development:
Use uvicorn with live reloading. This will automatically restart the server whenever you save a file.

uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5001 --reload

For Production (e.g., on Render):
Use gunicorn to run the application with multiple worker processes.

gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app

‚öôÔ∏è API Usage
Once the server is running, you can interact with the API endpoint.

Interactive Docs (Swagger UI)
The easiest way to test the endpoint is by using the automatic documentation generated by FastAPI. While the server is running, navigate to:

http://127.0.0.1:5001/docs

This interface allows you to upload a file and see the response directly in your browser.

API Endpoint
POST /analyze-resume/

This endpoint accepts a multipart/form-data request with a single file.

Form Field: resume

File Type: application/pdf

Example curl Request
Make sure you are in a directory containing your test resume.

curl -X POST -F "resume=@/path/to/your/resume.pdf" [http://127.0.0.1:5001/analyze-resume/](http://127.0.0.1:5001/analyze-resume/)
